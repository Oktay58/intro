    <h1 id="titel1">About me</h1>
    <p id="text">Hello and welcome to my portfolio!<br> My name is Oktay Tecer, and I'm a 17-year-old student pursuing a career in software development at Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam. I'm passionate about technology and the limitless possibilities it offers in shaping our future.
        <br><br>
        In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a deep-rooted love for gaming. Whether I'm exploring vast virtual worlds, solving intricate puzzles, or competing in multiplayer battles, video games have always been a source of inspiration and entertainment for me. I see them not only as a form of recreation but also as an art form that combines storytelling, design, and technology.
        <br><br>
        When I'm not immersed in the digital realm, you can often find me on the basketball court. Playing basketball is not just a physical activity for me,
         it's a way to challenge myself, stay active, and foster teamwork. The synergy between teamwork on the court and collaborative coding in software development is a connection I find intriguing.
        <br><br>
        Throughout this portfolio, I look forward to sharing my journey as a software developer, showcasing the projects I've worked on, and highlighting how my love for gaming and basketball has influenced my approach to problem-solving and innovation. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work and insights.
    </p>
